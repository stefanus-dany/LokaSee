Description:
Location is one of the biggest factors to be considered when running a business (Rogalska, 2020). Fail to decide the right place heads to fail to get the target market as expected. To solve this problem, we are proposing a land renting/buying marketplace app to classify what type of business that can be run in a specific location and connect the stakeholders in one system (seller, buyer, and agent). We are planning to get this app working in an urban area as an MVP by focusing on restaurant business type as a first step towards the end goal and reiterate what we fall on to make a more suitable product for users. The main reason we want to solve this problem is how scarce it is to gather location information from the internet. It just doesn’t give us enough information other than the empirical data such as latitude and longitude. After developing this project in Bangkit, we’ll dive deeper into the market by doing market validation research and do what an actual business will do (making marketing channel, doing partnerships, and so on). Hopefully, this app’s features will grow larger by implementing more AI to it, such as helping people to find the most cost efficient housing area.
